# Balanced Brackets

A practical task from the interview. The essence of the task is to check all the brackets in the example. A correct example is considered if the brackets begin and end accordingly.

A bracket is considered to be any of the following characters – “(“, “)”, “[“, “]”, “{“, “}”.

A set of brackets is considered to be a matched pair if an opening bracket, “(“, “[“, and “{“, occurs to the left of the corresponding closing bracket, “)”, “]”,  and “}”, respectively.
