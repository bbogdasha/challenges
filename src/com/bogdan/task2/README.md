# Prinitive Binary

A practical task from the interview. The transmitted string must be changed to binary under the condition that all characters from "a" and "A" to "m" and "M" must be "0", and the remaining characters, from "n" and "H" to "z" and "Z", must be changed to "1".

```java
String s2 = "intellijIDEA";  --> 011000000000

```
